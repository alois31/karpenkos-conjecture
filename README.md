# Pre-computed Brown-Peterson cohomology of oriented Grassmannians

These are the pre-computed results corresponding to commit [54ceec7909d295a7ec8db23e5da4e6c60487b174](https://codeberg.org/alois3264/karpenkos-conjecture/src/commit/54ceec7909d295a7ec8db23e5da4e6c60487b174) on the main branch.
Each directory named `ogr$n` contains the following files concerning the Brown-Peterson cohomology of OGr(n):

* `stage1.sing`, `stage2.sing`, `stage3.sing`: intermediate files for the exact computations (n≤7 only)
* `exact`: final result of the exact computations (n≤7 only)
* `approximate`: final result of the approximate computations

Please see the main branch for instructions how to run the programs.
The files included here correspond directly either to intermediate files or the screen output.
